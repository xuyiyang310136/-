# Contributing
First of all, every participant should obey [_Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct_](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). In this project, Chinese and English both are welcoming. Besides, before starting working, I strongly recommend that all of you notify and talk with me (via email) first.


## Workflow
1. Fork the Handright repository;
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements;
3. Do your contribution;
4. Provide tests for any newly added code in `handright` package;
5. Run `pytest` in the project's root folder and run `tests/watch.py`;
6. Create a pull request to pull the changes to the `dev` branch.


## Guidelines
* Keep [_The Zen of Python_](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/#the-zen-of-python) in mind.
* One commit for one change.
* The recommended line length is 80 characters, even though the line length can be up to 120 characters.
* Documentations and Examples both are for released versions.
* Otherwise follow [_Google Python Style Guide_](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#google-python-style-guide).
* Contact me if you have any question.
